The _International Conference on the Art, Science, and Technology of Programming_ is a new conference focused on everything to do with programming including the experience of programming. We call it **‹Programming›** for short. Papers are welcome from any part of the programming research lifecycle, as are papers on programming practice and experience.


### Topics
_Art_: Aesthetics, coding style, programming for exploration and discovery, novelty seeking programs, programming in the arts and humanities, etc.

_Science_: Programming models, machine-learning for programming, individual and team methodology, productivity and effectiveness, conceptual discovery using code repositories (for example), automatic programming, error handling and tolerance, probabilistic programming, types, etc.

_Technology_: Abstraction, modularity, visual and lively languages, coding tools, debugging tools, programming by example, modeling tools and techniques, specialized languages, dynamic techniques, static techniques, proof technology, testing technology, acceptability techniques, errors, security, distributed and parallel computing languages, probabilistic programming languages, software development, software engineering, types, etc.

If the term “academic experimentalist” feels like it describes you, your work is likely what <Programming> is looking for.

Almost anything about programming is fair game, but in each case there should be a clear and direct relevance to the act and experience of programming. Essays reflecting on topics closely related to programming are likewise welcome.
