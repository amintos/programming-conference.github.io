The _International Conference on the Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming_ is a new conference focused on everything to do with programming including the experience of programming. We call it **‹Programming›** for short. Papers are welcome from any part of the programming research lifecycle, as are papers on programming practice and experience.

### Scholarly Submissions

‹Programming› accepts scholarly papers including essays. Evaluation criteria therefore vary according to the type of paper and the stage of work being presented. Papers about early stage research should be supported by compelling arguments, worked examples, or early engineering or scientific evidence. Papers about late stage research should be supported by strong scientific or mathematical evidence.

### Journal Affiliated

A new journal has been created as the publication vehicle for ‹Programming›. Papers submitted to this journal are reviewed by referees chosen by the ‹Programming› Program Chair, who is an associate editor for the journal. Authors of accepted papers are invited to present at the conference as a requirement for publication.

### Plain Language

Each paper must be accompanied by a plain-language abstract that presents the key points in the paper in a manner understandable by experienced practitioners and researchers in nearby disciplines.

### Topics

_Art:_ Aesthetics, coding style, programming for exploration and discovery, novelty seeking programs, programming in the arts and humanities, etc.

_Science:_ Programming models, machine-learning for programming, individual and team methodology, productivity and effectiveness, conceptual discovery using code repositories (for example), automatic programming, error handling and tolerance, probabilistic programming, types, etc.

_Engineering:_ Abstraction, modularity, visual and lively languages, coding tools, debugging tools, programming by example, modeling tools and techniques, specialized languages, dynamic techniques, static techniques, proof technology, testing technology, acceptability techniques, errors, security, distributed and parallel computing languages, probabilistic programming languages, software development, software engineering, types, etc.

Almost anything about programming is fair game, but in each case there should be a clear and direct relevance to the act and experience of programming. Essays reflecting on topics closely related to programming are likewise welcome.
