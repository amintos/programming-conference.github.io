The [LNCS Transactions on Modularity and Composition](http://www.springer.com/series/7584) aims to publish papers from any part of the programming research lifecycle, including papers on programming practice and experience. 

Papers submitted are reviewed by referees chosen by the ‹Programming› Program Chair, who is an associate editor for the journal. Authors of accepted papers are invited to present at the conference as a requirement for publication.

Each paper must be accompanied by a plain-language abstract that presents the key points in the paper in a manner understandable by experienced practitioners and researchers in nearby disciplines.
